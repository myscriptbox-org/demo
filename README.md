#myscriptbox.org demo
Since the myscriptbox tools were built entirely using myscriptbox itself, they are a good demo of what you can do with the myscriptbox tools.

But then again, all real-life programs really do some real work, and may therefore be a bit too elaborate just to have a quick glance at how set up things. This hello-world demo is limited to just demonstrating the basic publication process.

It will not bother you with real algorithms, that you can ordinarily find in real programs.
